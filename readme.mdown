* [Mimicking Links](https://github.com/ryanfitzer/Demos)  
    
    Various configurations of element attributes and/or non-anchor elements to mimic the look (styling) and functionality (mouse & keyboard) of standard links. I originally created this based on a post of mine, [To Be, or Not to Be, an Anchor](http://ryanfitzer.org/2011/08/to-be-or-not-to-be-an-anchor/). Definitely not an exhaustive list, but a great starting point. Any forks and pull requests are appreciated.
