# Demos

A repository to house all the POC's, tests and demos I create.


## Control Hover Intention

[Demo](http://ryanfitzer.github.io/Demos/hover/)

Demonstration of how to manage unintended displays when a user casually uses their mouse to glance around an interface.


## Mimicking Links

[Demo](http://ryanfitzer.github.io/Demos/mimic-links/)

Various configurations of element attributes and/or non-anchor elements to mimic the look (styling) and functionality (mouse & keyboard) of standard links. I originally created this based on a post of mine, [To Be, or Not to Be, an Anchor](http://ryanfitzer.org/2011/08/to-be-or-not-to-be-an-anchor/).


## Apache Commands

Examples of some apache commands I find helpful during development. Instructions are contained in the .htaccess file included. A functioning example is not available due to github pages lack of support for apache. You'll need to run this in your own environment.
