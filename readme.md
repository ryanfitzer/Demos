### Apache Commands ###

Examples of some apache commands I find helpful during development. Instructions are contained in the .htaccess file included. A functioning example is not available due to github pages lack of support for apache. You'll need to run this in your own environment.


### Control Hover Intention ###

[Demo](http://ryanfitzer.github.io/Demos/hover/)

Demonstration of how to manage unintended displays when a user casually uses their mouse to glance around an interface.


### Mimicking Links ###

[Demo](http://ryanfitzer.github.io/Demos/mimic-links/)

Various configurations of element attributes and/or non-anchor elements to mimic the look (styling) and functionality (mouse & keyboard) of standard links. I originally created this based on a post of mine, [To Be, or Not to Be, an Anchor](http://ryanfitzer.org/2011/08/to-be-or-not-to-be-an-anchor/). Definitely not an exhaustive list, but a great starting point. Any forks and pull requests are appreciated.
